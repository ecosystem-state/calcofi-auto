## Overview 
This repository is a demonstration of automatic index generation using data from CalCOFI and ERDDAP. The index is generated by applying Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) to the top ~ 50 species, using spring samples collected 1985 - present.

## Results

We find that a model with 3 trends has better predictive accuracy than a model with 1-2 trends. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Estimated trends for the CalCOFI community"}
# All defaults
include_graphics("figures/trends.jpeg")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Estimated loadings for the CalCOFI community"}
# All defaults
include_graphics("figures/loadings.jpeg")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, width = 8, fig.cap="Predicted and observed fits to the CalCOFI data"}
# All defaults
include_graphics("figures/fitted.jpeg")
```
