## Overview

This repository is a demonstration of automatic index generation using
data from CalCOFI and ERDDAP. The index is generated by applying Dynamic
Factor Analysis (DFA) to the top \~ 50 species, using spring samples
collected 1985 - present.

## Results

We find that a model with 3 trends has better predictive accuracy than a
model with 1-2 trends.
